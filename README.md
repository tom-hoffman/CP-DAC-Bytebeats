# Circuit Playground Express DAC Bytebeats

Direct fork of https://github.com/MacroMachines/Teensy-DAC-Bytebeats to work out of the box with the Adafruit Circuit Playground.

The only trivial changes is changing the DAC pin from A14 (teensy 3.1) to A0 (Circuit Playground Express).

Circuit Playground port of experimental synthesizers using various arbitrary math to create audio output on the teensy 3.1 DAC pin
